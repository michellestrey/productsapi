Api using Spring and local database to learning.  

Applying basic CRUD operations for application development. 

This repository is part of my learning process as I explore software development concepts and tools.

## **What I'm learning...**  :gear:

- Bulding REST APIs using Spring Boot.
- Implementing CRUD(Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.
- Working with relational databases (H2 in this case).
- Managing projects with Git and GitHub.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

### **Future Goals**  :wrench:
- Add authentication and authorization.
- Explore additional databases.
